## Future Scope

Here are a few features I've planned to enhance the application further:

-   **Admin & Moderation Tools:**
    -   Implement an admin role that has the ability to view the real username of users posting in anonymous mode. This is crucial for moderation and ensuring a safe chat environment.

-   **Private "Whisper" Messages:**
    -   Allow a user to select one or more specific people in the group chat and send a "whispered" message. This message would be hidden from everyone else, enabling semi-private conversations within the main group channel.

-   **Live Typing Indicators:**
    -   Add a "user is typing..." indicator to make the conversation feel more alive and interactive.
